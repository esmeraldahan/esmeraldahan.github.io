                     <p> Taking note from last class, I really found the publishing date of this article brings fun and insights to the overall argument.

                      <p> "As We May Think" by Vannevar Bush, published in The Atlantic in 1945, reflects on the advancement of technology and its impact on the way we access and process information

                      <p>Bush envisioned a future where machines would play a significant role in our daily lives and simplify the task of finding and organizing information.

                       <p>Bush introduced the idea of the "Memex," a machine that could store and retrieve vast amounts of information, revolutionizing the way we store, process, and access information. Which is, I believe, a familiar daily-use to us right now.

The articleâ€™s predictions have largely come to fruition, with the development of computers, the Internet, and the World Wide Web, all of which have transformed the way we access and use information.
